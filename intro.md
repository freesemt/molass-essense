<font color="orange">WARNING: This book is in preparation to be publicly browsable in April, 2025.</font>

Molass Library, as its name suggests, is a library style rewrite of [MOLASS](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biophysico/20/1/20_e200001/_article), an analytical tool for SEC-SAXS experiment data currently ported at [Photon Factory](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASS.html). It is designed to be suitable for scripting in Jupyter notebooks, thereby obtaining greater flexibility compared to the predecessor thanks to the Python ecosystem diversity.

This document describes the theoretical essense of the library. You can read the chapters of the left sidebar, for ordinary use, in the listed order, or use the search box to find what you are interested in.
